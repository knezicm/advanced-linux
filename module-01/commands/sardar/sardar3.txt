* Sardar Tiger
*

a big tiger escaped from its cage. The zoo officials sent everyone out
of the zoo and closed the main gate. Now the tiger is inside the zoo but
wandering freely.Zoo people requested sardar to go inside and trap the
tiger in a cage.Scared but to avoid insult he went into the zoo in his
jeep carrying a big gun. While driving on one of the zoo's roads, he
noticed that the tiger is chasing him. Feeling scared he drove the jeep
fast but only to observe that the tiger is very near to the jeep. At
that time the road separated into
two paths ahead, one to the left and other to the right. Then cleverly
dhakaal put the left indicator on and turned the jeep to the road on
right. The tiger runs into the left path. With a sigh of relief, he
drove forward. After some time the roads meet and the same situation
arises again. once more the road divides into two and this time our
sardar is smart enough to put the right indicator on and turned to left.
This time the tiger goes into the road on right side. After some time
the roads meet again to our sardar's misfortune and the tiger starts to
chase him again. This time the road never divides and our sardar thought
the tiger would catch him. Then a brilliant idea struck his mind. He
slows down his jeep taking it to the left corner of the road. Then
he held his hand outside and a gives signal which is given for vehicles
which want to overtake. The tiger this time overtakes his jeep and runs
forward.

Result :- There are Sardar Communities in Tigers too.

three pints of "Desi Daru"and sits in the back of
the room, drinking a sip out of each one
inturn. When he finishes them, he comes back
to the bar and orders three more.
The bartender asks him, "You know, a pint
goes flat after I draw it; it would taste better if
you bought one at a time."
The Sardar replies, "Well, you see, I have
two brothers. One is in America, the other in
Dubai, and I'm here in Punjab. When we all
left home, we promised that we'd drink this
way to remember the days when we drank
together."
The bartender admits that this is a nice
custom, and leaves it there. The Sardar
becomes a regular in the bar, and always
drinks the same way: He orders three pints
and drinks them in turn. One day, he comes in and orders two pints. All
the other regulars notice and fall silent.

When he comes back to the bar for the second
round, the bartender says, "I don't want to
intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my
condolences on your great loss."

then a light dawns in his eye and he laughs.
"Oh, no," he, says, "everyone's fine. I've just
quit drinking."

This is about a day when Mr. Zail was the President of
the country. All sardars in the country went to him this day and told him
that people tease them by making jokes about them that when the clock
stucks 12:00, all sardars go mad and act like crazy. They complained that
this is not true. They also complained that people talk about sardar
having no common sanse. Therefore, they demanded him to go bring for
them common sense.
Mr. Zail Singh was confused and asked his secretary to give him some
suggestions. The secretary advised him to go to Japan, since quality is
guaranteed.
The next day Mr. Zail Singh rushes off to Japan. At the Osaka Airport he
hires a cab and asks him to take him to a shop where he can get common
sense.
The cab driver was pissed, he told him that there is no shop in Japan
that sells such stuff. Infact every human being has common sense since
birth. And that one should know how to make use of it. Mr. Zail Singh
asked him to explain in detail.
He started explaining by giving an example. The example was that there
are 4 members in his family, his wife, his son, and his daughter. He
then asked Mr. Zail Singh to guess the fourth members of the family. Mr.
Zail Singh said, "How am i supposed to know who is the forth member in
your family". The driver said, "fool, its me"
Mr. Zail then understood and said,"oh! is this what common sense is?,
Indian sardars are fools and stupid, this is so easy!"
The next day he goes back to India and announces all sardars to get
together for a mass sardar lunch. He starts explaining with the same
example. He says," there are 4 members in my family, my son, my
daughter, and my wife, guess who is the fourth one?". All sardars
shouted, "We don't know".

He then yells at them,"You fools, stupid, good for nothing. It is so
simple, the fourth member of the family is that taxi driver"

    This is is a letter from a sardarji mother to her
    son at school ...
    Pyaarey Puttar,
    Vahe Guru. I am writing this letter slow because I
    know you can't read fast. We don't live where we
    did when you left home. Your dad read in the
    newspaper that most accidents happen 20 miles
    from your home, so we moved! I won't be able to
    give you the address as the last sardar who stayed
    in this house took the numbers with them for their
    next house, so they wouldnt have to change their
    address.
    This place is really nice. It even has a washing
    machine. I'm not sure it works too well, last week
    I put in three shirts and pulled the chain and I
    HAVE NOT SEEN THEM SINCE.
    THE weather here isn't too bad. It rained only twice
    last week. The first it rained for three days and the
    second time for four days. The coat you wanted me
    to send you, your aunt said it would be a little too
    heavy to send in the mail with all the buttons, so we
    cut them off and put them in the pocket.
    We got another bill from the funeral home. It said
    that if we don't make the last payment on
    GRANDMA'S FUNERAL, she will come up again.
    Your father has another job. He has 500 men under
    him. He is cutting the grass in the cemetery. Your
    sister had a baby this morning, I havent found out
    whether it is a boy or girl, so I don't know whether
    you are an aunt or uncle!
    Your uncle jatindar fell into a whiskey vat. Some
    men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off
    and drowned. We cremated him and he burned for
    3 days.
    Three of your friends went off the bridge in a
    pick-up truck. One was driving and the other two
    were in the back. the driver got out, he rolled down
    the window and swam to safety. the other 2 friends
    drowned because they couldn't get the gate down.

*there isn't much more news at this time. nothing much has happened.*

*love, mom
p.s. i was going to send you some money, but the
envelope was already sealed.*

art teacher gave the assignment that he must paint
something. The sardarji did not know what to
paint, so the teacher told him to paint that which
he felt was the most beautiful thing in the world.

beautiful than my village, so I shall paint that.
The sardarji spent all his time working on the
painting the next day. He did not eat, sleep, or
take a bath.


Finally, he took the painting to his art teacher.
His art teacher was amazed at the detail of the
picture, but he said, "No, no, there is something
missing. Go back to your village and see what you
have missed."


The sardarji went back to his village and revised his
painting. The next day in class, he returned with
the painting. He presented a black canvas to
his instructor. His instructor said, "What! You fool!
I said revise not destroy!"


The sardarji said, "Well you told me to paint what I
was missing, so I went back to the village, and looked
for a long time. Then, there was a power outage, so I
thought to myself this is what I am missing, so I painted
black!"

*A Sardar Computer Illiterate:*

True story from a Novell NetWire SysOp:

Caller: "Hello, is this Tech Support?"

Tech: "Yes, it is. How may I help you?"

Caller: "The cup holder on my PC is broken and I am
within my warranty period. How do I go about getting that fixed?"

Tech: "I'm sorry, but did you say a cup holder?"

Caller: "Yes, it's attached to the front of my computer."

Tech: "Please excuse me if I seem a bit stumped, It's
because
I am. Did you receive this as part of a promotional, at a
trade
show? How did you get this cup holder? Does it have
any trademark
on it?"

Caller: "It came with my computer, I don't know
anything about a
promotional. It just has '4X' on it."

At this point the Tech Rep had to mute the caller, because
he couldn't stand it.
The caller had been using the load drawer of the CD-ROM
drive as a cup holder,

_ Train Journey_
Once a Sardarji was traveling on a train. He felt
sleepy so he gave the guy sitting opposite him on the train 20 rupees to
wake him up when the station arrived. This guy was a barber, and he felt
that for 20 rupees, the sardarji deserved more service. So, when the
Sardarji fell asleep, the barber quietly shaved off his beard. When the
station arrived, the Sardarji was woken up, and he went home. Reaching
home, he went to wash his face, and suddenly screamed when he saw the
mirror. Said his wife " What's the matter?" Replied he "The cheat on the
train has taken my 20 rupees and woken up someone else"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
_ Sardar's Maruthi_
One fine morning found Sardarji driving his new
Maruti (which he called marrruttti very affectionately). Sardarji was
very happy to be the owner of a marrruttti and was singing to himself.
Suddenly, he collided with the milkman. The accident caused much damage
to the milkman's bicycle and our guy was furious. Sardarji ran towards
him mumbling apologies, but the our guy was not pacified. He shouted
"Sardar, khoon ka badla khoon, torfoor ka badla torfoor". Saying so, he
got a stout stick and starting hammering it on the windshield. Sardarji
was shocked and tried to take the stick from him, requesting him to
stop. But the milkman (who was incidently very stout) got hold of the
Sardarji and carried him ten meters away from his marrruttti. He drew a
small circle near the road with the stick and asked Sardarji to stay
inside and not move outside the circle, threatening him with his stout
stick for better measure. Now our Sardarji was not very brave at heart
and coolly went to stand in the circle. Our milkman goes back to what he
had left in the middle and starts on the headlights. After this, he
starts on the rearlights. As soon as he breaks the first one, he hears a
faint chuckle from the Sardarji. He breaks the other one, now he could
distinctly hear the Sardarji laugh slightly. Enraged, he goes to the
Sardarji and asks him why he was laughing. Sardarji says that it was
nothing. He comes backs and resumes his assault on the poor marrruttti
and as he goes on in this act, Sardarji's laughs become louder and
louder. Enraged, the milkman increases his assault , but the laughs keep
on increasing rather than decreasing. At last, the milkman can't stop
himself. He goes to the Sardar and taking him by the collar, asks him
the reason for laughing. Our Sardar at first says it was nothing, but
when the milkman starts getting really rough, he breaks down. He says
"If I tell you, you will beat me". The milkman, now very curious,
promises not to do anything if the Sardar tells him. Satisfied about his
safety, our Sardarji says "You know, while u were engaged there, I came
out of the circle seventeen times.

Banta Singh and Santa Singh got tired using cell phones and for a
change decided to use really ancient methods of communication. They
decided to use pigeons to send messages. So they went and bought
expensive carrier pigeons from the Jama Masjid market in old Delhi
and found to their joy that the pigeons indeed could be trained and
the birds very easily learnt to return directly to their respective
homes. And so this scheme worked very fine.
One day Santa sends his pigeon. When the pigeon reaches to Banta it
is with out message. Banta picked his mobile and asked Santa "What
is this joke? The pigeon is without any message!!!"
Santa said "Oye khoteya, this was a missed call.".........lol............

2. There are 12 seconds in a year.
Saint Peter said, "OK, I'll buy the Today and Tomorrow, even though it's not
